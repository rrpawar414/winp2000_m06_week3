# Learning About Linux üêß

### Introduction
This document provides a comprehensive overview of Linux, including its history, key distributions, and essential commands. Understanding Linux is crucial for anyone interested in system administration, programming, or exploring open-source software.

### Section 1: Linux History üìú
Linux was created in 1991 by **Linus Torvalds**, a Finnish computer science student. Torvalds released the Linux kernel, which became the core component of an open-source operating system. His goal was to develop a free and robust alternative to the MINIX operating system.

**Key Contributors**:
- **Linus Torvalds**: Original creator of the Linux kernel.
- **Richard Stallman**: Founder of the Free Software Foundation, promoting the GNU operating system, which combined with Linux to form many popular distributions.

**Evolution and Significance**:
- **1991**: First version of the Linux kernel released.
- **1992**: Linux kernel version 1.0 released, featuring improved stability and functionality.
- **2000s**: Widespread adoption in servers and embedded systems due to its reliability and open-source nature.
- **Today**: Powers a significant portion of the internet, mobile devices (via Android), and many other systems.

### Section 2: Linux Distributions üåç
**Linux distributions** (or "distros") package the Linux kernel with additional software to cater to different needs. Each distribution provides a unique environment and set of tools.

Here are some popular Linux distributions:

| **Distribution** | **Description**                                                                 |
|------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Ubuntu**       | Known for its ease of use and strong community support, Ubuntu is ideal for beginners and general desktop use. |
| **Debian**       | Offers exceptional stability and long-term support, making it suitable for servers and critical applications. |
| **Fedora**       | Focuses on the latest technologies and innovation, maintained by Red Hat, and is known for its cutting-edge features. |
| **Arch Linux**   | A rolling release distro that emphasizes simplicity and customization, appealing to advanced users who want full control. |

### Section 3: Basic Linux Commands üñ•Ô∏è
Here‚Äôs a summary of essential Linux commands that every user should know:

| **Command** | **Description**                                                                 |
|-------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `ls`        | List files and directories in the current directory.                           |
| `cd`        | Change directories. Example: `cd Documents` moves to the Documents folder.    |
| `pwd`       | Print the current working directory.                                           |
| `mkdir`     | Create a new directory. Example: `mkdir new_folder` creates a folder named new_folder. |
| `cp`        | Copy files or directories. Example: `cp file.txt /path/to/destination/` copies file.txt. |
| `mv`        | Move or rename files or directories. Example: `mv oldname.txt newname.txt` renames a file. |
| `rm`        | Remove files or directories. Example: `rm file.txt` deletes file.txt.          |
| `sudo`      | Execute a command as the superuser. Example: `sudo apt-get update` updates the package list. |

### Conclusion üéì
Learning about Linux provides a valuable skill set for understanding open-source software and system administration. Linux's evolution from a student project to a global standard highlights its significance and flexibility in modern computing.

**Example Repository:**

Refer to the example repository [here](https://github.com/sojoudian/winp2000_m06_week3) for a sample of how the documentation should be structured.

**Submission:**

Each team member must push their `README.md` file to their Git repository (`winp2000_m06_week3`) and ensure it is publicly available or shared with the group for review. One member should submit a PDF containing the Git repository URLs of all group members.
